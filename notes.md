# PASSIVE VS ACTIVE, Connection establishment

In passive mode, both connections are established by the client (Protocol Interpeter(commands) & Data Transfer Process(data)).
The client indicates to the server to "listen" in certain port so the client can connect its channel.

In active mode, client establishes the PI but server is indicated to be proactive and establish the data connection to the client.

# Terminology
- PI.
